# This is a placeholder for Inter-Regular.ttf font file
# In a real project, you would download the actual Inter font from Google Fonts
# and place the .ttf files in this directory

# For development, Expo will fallback to system fonts if these files are missing
# To add real fonts:
# 1. Download Inter font family from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter
# 2. Extract the .ttf files to this directory
# 3. Update the font loading in App.tsx
